doesnt seem 100% anymore"},{"text":"he was a great buy for sure"},{"text":"na i know he gotta play now because we bought him but maybe we could have got someone else"},{"text":"People just get cranky since Meireles can't defend, but we knew that when we bought him"},{"text":"but I've never really been a fan of his defensive capabilities"},{"text":"i mean maybe.. but who would you have bought?"},{"text":"doesnt he play @ dmc usually though"},{"text":"no"},{"text":"oh yea"},{"text":"he's box-to-box"},{"text":"We wanted Modric and couldn't get him, so we got Meireles"},{"text":"he

up"},{"text":"yeah"},{"text":"wow"},{"text":"wow...."},{"text":"didnt even touch him"},{"text":"ok"},{"text":"i mean i understand the first two were bad"},{"text":"phew"},{"text":"kalou always seems

have him @ team"},{"text":"I need to see that again"},{"text":"does look like he clipped kalou"},{"text":"I don't think he got the ball there"},{"text":"and the ball"},{"text":"well, we need to step it up"},{"text":"150th prem goal for lamps?"},{"text":"chances"},{"text":"*!"},{"text":"i mean.. i can see why he gave the pen"},{"text":"well"},{"text":"yeah"},{"text":"but it wasnt malicious"},{"text":"yeah"},{"text":"but might have told what ref actually thought about it"},{"text":"isnt it impossible to give penalty without a card"},{"text":"no"},{"text":"if the player doesn't have an open path to goal and it's just a regular foul"},{"text":"then it will just be a pen"},{"text":"ffs meireles"},{"text":"jeez meireles"},{"text":"sub him now"},{"text":"ur right at the edge of the box"},{"text":"poor shot selection tonight"},{"text":"how'd you sky that"},{"text":"terry looks like hes taking it easy a bit"},{"text":"he's still injured"},{"text":"i know, i was just
